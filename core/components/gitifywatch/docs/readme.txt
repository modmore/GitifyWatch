Gitify Watch
============

No, it's not a smart watch.. but it is a really cool plugin for MODX Revolution!

Gitify Watch is a MODX plugin to complement the Gitify command line tool. It hooks into various MODX events,
and will automatically extract and commit changes you make.

The primary purpose of Gitify Watch is to be sure changes made directly on production are immediately pushed to the git
remote, so it is easy to keep a development server up to date. With project-specific development, it could also be a
starting point for building a complete workflow away from the command line.
